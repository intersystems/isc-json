# How to contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing! While this project originated at InterSystems, it is our hope that the community will continue to extend and enhance it.

## Submitting changes

If you have made a change that you would like to contribute back to the community, please send a [GitHub Pull Request](/pull/new/master) explaining it. If your change fixes an issue that you or another user reported, please mention it in the pull request. You can find out more about pull requests [here](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/).

Note that for this project we will not usually merge pull requests directly; we will vet them and fold them into an internal source of record for the package, then publish changes back out and close the PR.

## Coding conventions

Generally speaking, just try to match the conventions you see in the code you are reading. For this project, these include:

* Do not use shortened command and function names - e.g., `s` instead of `set`, `$p` instead of `$piece`
* One command per line
* Do not use dot syntax
* Indentation with tabs
* Pascal case class and method names
* Avoid using postconditionals
* Local variables start with `t`; formal parameter names start with `p`
* Always check %Status return values

Thanks,
Tim Leavitt, InterSystems Corporation
